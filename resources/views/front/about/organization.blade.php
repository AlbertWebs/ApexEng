                        <p>APEX Engineering strives to create a working environment that is conducive to technology transfer and professional development of all staff members.</p>
                        <p>APEX Engineering has been entrusted with projects which have enabled employment and training of a number of engineers and technicians at various stages of their career development. Some have continued their development with the company and others have been absorbed into the construction industry in Tanzania.</p>
                        <p>While the Companyâ€™s aim is to develop its own staff capacity, we also associate with other firms and institutions both local and foreign on assignments requiring specialized expertise or at times as required by project conditions such as design and build. This is also a way of accomplishing transfer of technology.</p>
